### LCD_Backpack
I used an LCD backpack in this assignment to print out the number of seconds since the code started running. This assignment was my first time using an LCD backpack, and I consider it to be a huge improvement on the massive amounts of wiring I had to do when I wasn't using it. While this assignment wasn't very exciting, it was extremely quick and it taught me new things about LCDs.

### LCD_ButtonCounter
The LCD Button Counter assignment was an assignment in which I used a button and an LCD to print the number of times the button was pressed to the LCD. This assignment was very fun, as it forced us to find a way to code a button the way most people think when they think of buttons. I think that this code will be very useful in the future if I ever decide to become an Engineer

### MotorControl
Motor Control was a project where we used a motor and potentiometer to have the motor spin a certain speed according to a potentiometer value. The coding for this was very easy and took me about five minutes to complete, but the wiring took almost five days. This would be ordinarily annoying, but it was even more frustrating for me when I found the only thing I needed to change was the position of the power and ground in relation to the transistor.

### Photo_Interrupter
For the photo interrupter project, I used a photo interrupter and an LED to power the LED whenever the photo interrupter dectected something. It was rather easy wiring, but the coding took a while to work, as we had to learn how to use an interrupt command. Overall a good project.

### Potentiometer1
The potentiometer project was a project in which I used a potentiometer to power an LED based on its value. It also printed the value to an LCD. This project was relatively easy. The only difficulty I ran into was figuring out to use an analog pin rather than a normal pin when wiring.

### Scoperino + 2
This project was an assembly of four different parts: a pin and three boxes of different sizes. We assembled these parts in solidworks in such a way that when you moved the pin, the boxes moved in a telescoping fashion. Thus, the name Scoperino. Scoperino was actually an assembly which combined the "Telescope" boxes and the pin(The file for the pin is named pin as a display of my immense creativity). This was a great way to quickly teach several different types of mates.

### Shpool
This was the assignment in which we created a spool. We learned how to do one very important thing; create design tables. These design tables allow me to strategically adjust the size of an object without recreating the piece.
