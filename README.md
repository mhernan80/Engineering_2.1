### LCD_Backpack
I used an LCD backpack in this assignment to print out the number of seconds since the code started running. This assignment was my first time using an LCD backpack, and I consider it to be a huge improvement on the massive amounts of wiring I had to do when I wasn't using it. While this assignment wasn't very exciting, it was extremely quick and it taught me new things about LCDs.

### LCD_ButtonCounter
The LCD Button Counter assignment was an assignment in which I used a button and an LCD to print the number of times the button was pressed to the LCD. This assignment was very fun, as it forced us to find a way to code a button the way most people think when they think of buttons. I think that this code will be very useful in the future if I ever decide to become an Engineer

### MotorControl
Motor Control was a project where we used a motor and potentiometer to have the motor spin a certain speed according to a potentiometer value. The coding for this was very easy and took me about five minutes to complete, but the wiring took almost five days. This would be ordinarily annoying, but it was even more frustrating for me when I found the only thing I needed to change was the position of the power and ground in relation to the transistor.

### Photo_Interrupter
For the photo interrupter project, I used a photo interrupter and an LED to power the LED whenever the photo interrupter dectected something. It was rather easy wiring, but the coding took a while to work, as we had to learn how to use an interrupt command. Overall a good project.

### Potentiometer1
The potentiometer project was a project in which I used a potentiometer to power an LED based on its value. It also printed the value to an LCD. This project was relatively easy. The only difficulty I ran into was figuring out to use an analog pin rather than a normal pin when wiring.

### Cstick..SLDPRT
The candlestick solidworks assignment was about what you would assusme: a candlestick. I learned how to use sweeps in this assignment.

### MinecraftPressurePlate.SLDPRT
In this assignment I created a pressure plate (It's not a Minecraft pressure plate but I decided to name it that because Minecraft is one of the few places I have heard that term be used). Since it was a tutorial it was rather easy, but clicking through all the steps I already knew how to do was irritating.

### ShellBoi.SLDPRT
In this assignment I created half of some sort of box. I'm not sure what this assignment was supposed to be for but it was kind of fun. I think it's just because I really like small containers.

### ShellBoi2.SLDPRT
This is the lid to the other half of the box. It was rather easy to make but I had some trouble cutting the spot where the boxes would fit together.

### ShellBoiAssembly.SLDASM
This is an assembly of the other two parts. It was very easy and only took a few mates to finish.

### Mjolnir.SLDPRT
For this assignment I created a hammer(If you don't know why it's called Mjolnir then I recommend you go read up on some norse mythology). It was a culmination of my abilities that I learned while doing the other projects, and additionally taught me how to use lofts.

### Hallo_Functions
In this assignment, I used an ultrasonic sensor that turned a continuous rotation servo a certain amount forwards or backwards based on the distance returned. This assignment taught me how to use ultrasonic sensors and how to use functions, both of which are very useful skills to have.

### NewPing
In the New Ping assignment I ran an ultrasonic sensor using functions from the New Ping library. This assignment was very fun as it was fast and a huge improvement on the amount of work I did in Hello Functions.

### Scoperino + 2
This project was an assembly of four different parts: a pin and three boxes of different sizes. We assembled these parts in solidworks in such a way that when you moved the pin, the boxes moved in a telescoping fashion. Thus, the name Scoperino. Scoperino was actually an assembly which combined the "Telescope" boxes and the pin(The file for the pin is named pin as a display of my immense creativity).
