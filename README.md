### Scoperino + 2
This project was an assembly of four different parts: a pin and three boxes of different sizes. We assembled these parts in solidworks in such a way that when you moved the pin, the boxes moved in a telescoping fashion. Thus, the name Scoperino. Scoperino was actually an assembly which combined the "Telescope" boxes and the pin(The file for the pin is named pin as a display of my immense creativity). This was a great way to quickly teach several different types of mates.

### Shpool
This was the assignment in which we created a spool. We learned how to do one very important thing; create design tables. These design tables allow me to strategically adjust the size of an object without recreating the piece.
